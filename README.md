### Actual Experience - React tech test

# The brief

Please complete the following tasks using ES6+ features, SASS and React.  Please avoid using styling libraries and off-the-shelf components, this is all about you showing us how good you can make things look, behave and perform. 


Build a React application that has the following components: 
    
  - A login page.  It should “log in” to an application which shows the below components.  The login page should include at least username and password fields and a login button.  This is a chance to show off your styling and markup skills, so feel free to go wild.  It doesn’t need to perform authentication, just present a form which can proceed to the next page. 

  - A functional form toggle control such as a toggle switch.

  - A functional drop down <select> with count badges which can accept the following data format:
      [ 
        { value: “foo”, count: 10 }, 
        { value: “bar”, count: 32 },
        // ... 
      ]
